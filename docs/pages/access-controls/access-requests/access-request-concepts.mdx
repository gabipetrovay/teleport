It is possible for a reviewer to view Resource Access Requests for SSH Nodes to
which that reviewer does not have access.
In this case, the reviewer will not be able to view the hostname of the requested node
and they will only see the node's UUID.

To give the reviewer permission to view the Node hostname, use the
`allow.review_requests.preview_as_roles` field in the reviewer's role, e.g.:

```
kind: role
spec:
  allow:
    review_requests:
      preview_as_roles: [access]
```

This can often be set to the same value as `allow.review_requests.roles`.
When any of the `preview_as_roles` set for the reviewer would allow access to
the requested node, the hostname will be displayed in the Review Request page of
the Teleport Web UI.
