Users can also create Access Requests with the `tsh request create` command.
`tsh request create` supports flags to control TTLs for the request and
elevated access. See the [CLI
Reference](../../reference/cli/tsh.mdx#tsh-request-create) for more
details.

By default, Teleport will allow users to request access to a role until the
current session expires. This can be overridden by setting the `max_duration`
when requesting access to a role. The `max_duration` option allows users to
extend their access up to 7 days. The `max_duration` can be set in the Web UI
or via the `--max-duration` flag when using the `tsh` CLI.

To enable the `max_duration` feature, the `max_duration` option must be set in
a user's role definition:
```yaml
kind: role
version: v5
metadata:
  name: contractor
spec:
  allow:
    request:
      # Allow access to role `dba` for up to 4 days.
      roles: ['dba']
      max_duration: 4d
```

Max duration extends access to a role for the specified duration, but each
session is still limited by the `max_session_ttl` option in the role definition.
For example, if the `max_session_ttl` is set to 1 hour, the user will be able
to request access to the role for up to 4 days, but each session will expire
after 1 hour. The user will need to assume the role again to continue using it.
If the `max_session_ttl` is not set, the session will expire after 12 hours.

It is possible for a reviewer to view Resource Access Requests for SSH Nodes to
which that reviewer does not have access.
In this case, the reviewer will not be able to view the hostname of the requested node
and they will only see the node's UUID.

To give the reviewer permission to view the Node hostname, use the
`allow.review_requests.preview_as_roles` field in the reviewer's role, e.g.:

```
kind: role
spec:
  allow:
    review_requests:
      preview_as_roles: [access]
```

This can often be set to the same value as `allow.review_requests.roles`.
When any of the `preview_as_roles` set for the reviewer would allow access to
the requested node, the hostname will be displayed in the Review Request page of
the Teleport Web UI.
