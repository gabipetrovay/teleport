Teleport Machine ID enables machines, such as CI/CD workflows, to securely
authenticate with your Teleport cluster in order to connect to resources and
configure the cluster itself. This is sometimes referred to as Machine to
Machine (or M2M) access.

Machine ID supports a number of use-cases and platforms, but is commonly used
for:

- Granting CI/CD workflows access to resources such as SSH servers,
  Kubernetes Clusters, Databases and Applications that are protected by Teleport
  in order to deploy changes.
- Granting SecOps tooling access to resources in order to run security analysis
  against them.
- Creating and renewing credentials for custom scripts that leverage `tctl` or
  the Teleport API in order to control Teleport configuration.

Machine ID's design brings the existing benefits of the Teleport platform to
machine access, including:

- Short-lived, rotating certificate-based credentials.
- Rich auditing and session recording.
- Fine-grained role-based access control.
- Consistency with your techniques for managing human access.

## Overview

At its core, Machine ID is about providing machines with an identity that is
compatible with the Teleport cluster. As with human users, this identity is
encoded into an x.509 certificate which is signed by the Teleport Auth Server.
This certificate then allows the machine to access resources through Teleport
and for this access to be tied to this identity.

The type of identity issued to a machine in Teleport is known as a Bot. Like
human users, a Bot's access is controlled through roles and their access is
subject to the same rich auditing.

The main difference between a human user and a bot is that a bot does not
"log in" using a static username and password. Instead, Teleport's join token
mechanism is used. This allows a machine to exchange one form of identity
(e.g AWS IAM) for a Teleport identity and this exchange process eliminates the
use of long-lived secrets for authentication.

Machine ID is used through an agent called `tbot`. `tbot` authenticates
with the Teleport cluster and then writes short-lived credentials and
configuration files (known as artifacts) to configured destinations (such as a
directory). These credentials can then be used by other tools to access a
Teleport cluster and its resources. In daemon mode, `tbot` continually renews
the short-lived credentials before they expire.

[architecture page](./architecture.mdx). This covers the behind-the-scenes
elements of how Machine ID functions and provides a strong background knowledge
which can help in successfully deploying Machine ID.
